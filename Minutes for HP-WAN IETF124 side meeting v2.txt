4 November, 09:45–10:45, Montreal

Participants:

Tim Chrown, Daniel King, Magnos Martinello, Tony, Everson Scherrer Borges,
Hiroshika, Rafael Guimaraes, Daniel Huang, Quan Xiong, Ran Chen, Ran Pang,
Min Xiao, Xueyan Song, Guangyu Zhao, Ruibo Han, Chenhao Ma, Tianyi Huang

The agenda and notes are below.

1. Note Well, welcome statements, introductions, and agenda bash (5 min)

2. HP-WAN document updates (State of the Art and Framework)
   Presenters: Quan Xiong (10 min)

   Quan, Daniel King, and Daniel Huang provided an update on the two HP-WAN
   documents.

   Hiroshika: I also operate an audio-infrastructure research and education
   network. Have you studied current operations and traffic engineering in
   research and education networks?

   Daniel King: Yes. As described in the state-of-the-art document, we have
   authors who build and operate R&E networks. It reflects practice in North
   America, Europe, and two Chinese networks, and the tools are applied both
   offline and online. We would welcome a Japanese example and your scenarios.

   Hiroshika: The orchestration or controller work is good, but partnerships
   are based on MOUs across the community and depend on collaboration. I
   suggest studying Layer-3 operations and traffic engineering, and
   understanding mechanisms to control or align resources for activities.

   Daniel King: The networks are operated separately at Layer 3 with end-to-end
   services and connectivity. Orchestration, scheduling, and end-to-end
   signaling may be required.

3. HP-WAN Hackathon plan
   Presenter: Daniel King (10 min)

   Daniel King: Introduced current coding work and the plan for the HP-WAN
   Hackathon at IETF125.

   Hiroshika: Do you consider path configuration across multiple paths?
   Signalling for path configuration could be a use case but is not included
   in your Hackathon.

   Daniel King: That is an interesting topic. I will talk to others to see if
   they support it. We can discuss offline and move it to the mailing list.

   Daniel King: IETF is a good community to implement. We spend time on theory
   and documents, and we encourage people to write code and apply best practice.

4. PolKA
   Presenter: Magnos Martinello (20 min)

   Magnos Martinello: Introduced PolKA and discussed future work to help with
   HP-WAN.

   Tony: Trafino chipsets are no longer available. What can be used to access
   PolKA?

   Magnos: There is time to deploy into a final switch. There are other options, too.

   Daniel King: Would it be feasible to run path computation locally and
   translate it into whatever chipset instruction set is available in each
   forwarding domain? Do you see a hierarchical approach where one domain has
   P4 and another has a different chipset? It would need hardware-agnostic
   instructions.

   Magnos Martinello: It can work similarly to MPLS. There are gateways to
   translate and encapsulate from one domain to another, so the network can
   run PolKA natively.

   Daniel King: Assume we monitor application latency and bandwidth requirements.
   Endpoint application requests are a scenario in HP-WAN. We aim to standardise
   application-to-network interaction, either directly to a distributed control
   plane, via an intermediary device, or via an orchestrator/controller.

   Daniel King: Do you have plans for the Hackathon? Could the PolKA team
   contribute running code or input on the APIs used by your controller or
   orchestrator?

   Magnos Martinello: Not sure yet. We need to assess feasibility. We have
   several simulation environments.

   Daniel King: The Hackathon will happen at the next IETF. The purpose is to
   demonstrate implementations and collaborate on prototyping IETF work.
   Depending on the operator, this may be a use case or a potential architecture.
   IETF has building blocks that can be applied. We want to present a clear use
   case and demonstrate HP-WAN objective functions. There are third-party and
   open-source tools. We aim to publish everything as part of the Hackathon and
   integrate to show this.

From chat:

- Tim: Maybe we could get an ESnet review, e.g., from Eli Dart or Dale Carder.
  Their network is also mentioned, and ESnet has a strong track record.
- Everson Scherrer Borges: The PolKA approach works with eBPF, DPDK, and P4.
  It can be used in any topology that supports those technologies.
- Quan: A key HP-WAN challenge is scalability during resource reservation and
  admission control. Consider how PolKA could help.

Next steps:

1. Organise a meeting next month to drill into HP-WAN Hackathon scenarios, and
   continue discussion on the mailing list.
   
2. Look to publish the two HP-WAN documents.

3. HP-WAN Hackathon at IETF125.
